## Introduction:
Most investment decisions involve the assessment of both qualitative and quantitative
decisions including evaluation of a complex set of interplay among these factors. The
house selection process exemplifies the type of investment decision where much of the
evaluation is qualitative. The prospective house buyer faces the daunting task of
evaluating a large and diverse array of information before being able to reach a rational
decision. The proposed house buyer faces the many jobs of estimating a huge and various
data before being ready to reach a reasonable judgment. In the beginning, he has to
narrow the search for houses. After that, he could be a very large number of houses.
Then, the purchaser requires collecting data from these houses. After that, even if data on
each house were found, the buyer needs to estimate the myriad of characteristics
connected with each property. Finally, the buyer needs to combine the judgmental
evaluation of houses with the listed price both for purposes of ranking the final choices
and for the negotiations process.
